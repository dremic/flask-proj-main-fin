Maman died today. Or yesterday maybe, I don't know.
I got a telegram from the home: "Mother deceased.
Funeral tomorrow. Faithfully yours." That doesn't mean
anything. Maybe it was yesterday.
The old people's home is at Marengo, about eighty
kilometers from Algiers, I'll take the two o'clock bus and
get there in the afternoon. That way I can be there for the
vigil and come back tomorrow night. I asked my boss for
two days off and there was no way he was going to refuse me with an excuse like that. But he wasn't too
happy about it. I even said, "It's not my fault." He didn't
say anything. Then I thought I shouldn't have said that.
After all, I didn't have anything to apologize for. He's
the one who should have offered his condolences. But he
probably will day after tomorrow, when he sees I'm in
mourning. For now, it's almost as if Maman weren't dead.
After the funeral, though, the case will be closed, and
everything will have a more official feel to it.
